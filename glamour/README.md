## Working with Git

### Create a new branch and send pull request

When you finish working on the task and the branch is ready to be merged, you need to create a pull request.
And afterwards you will need to checkout into main branch and merge the branch.

1. `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "commit message"`
4. `git push origin <branch-name>`
5. Send a pull request on GitHub.
    - First git to the github repo and click on the `Pull requests` tab. (green button on the right)
    - Click on the `New pull request` button.
    - Select the branch you want to merge with the main branch. (if it is not auto selected)
    - Write a description of the changes you made.
    - Click on the `Create pull request` button. (click on me AlisherXujanov as a reviewer)
